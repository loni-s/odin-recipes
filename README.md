# odin-recipes
Objectives:
1. Build main index page for recipe website.
2. Create links to several recipes.

Self-Reflection:
A simple project that allowed me solid practice in order to commit simple elements and web site organization to memory.  I actually thing the greatest takeaway from this project is that I need to continue practicing with git in order to improve my fluency with it, as working with the repository was the most uncomfortable portion of this project.
