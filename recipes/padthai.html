    <h5>A stir-fry packed with flavor that can be made in under 30 minutes.</h5>
    <p>Pad Thai is stir-fry dish made with rice noodles, shrimp, chicken, or tofu, peanuts, a scrambled egg 
      and bean sprouts. The ingredients are sautéed together in a wok and tossed in a delicious Pad Thai sauce. 
      It’s a common street food in Thailand and one of the most popular menu items at Thai restaurants around 
      the country.</p>
    <p>To make vegan or vegetarian pad Thai, leave out the egg and substitute the fish sauce for more soy sauce.
        <em>Note:</em> Traditional pad thai sauce includes fish sauce, vinegar, sugar and tamarind paste. 
        Tamarind paste is not easily found at a regular grocery stores so I substituted rice vinegar. If you 
        would like to use tamarind paste, substitute about 2 Tablespoons in place of the rice vinegar in this 
        recipe. I also added a big scoop of peanut butter to my sauce, because I think it gives the whole dish 
        an added creaminess and boost of flavor that I love.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <h3>Main Dish:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>8 ounces flat rice noodles</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked shrimp, chicken, or extra-firm tofu , cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh bean sprouts</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry roasted peanuts</li>
        <li>2 limes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>For the Pad Thai sauce:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>3 Tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>5 Tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons rice vinegar, or Tamarind Paste*</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Sriracha hot sauce, or more, to taste</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons creamy peanut butter* (optional)</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Cook noodles according to package instructions, just until tender.  Rinse under cold water.</li>
        <li>Make sauce by combining sauce ingredients in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Stir Fry:: Heat 1½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the 
          shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper. The shrimp will cook quickly, about 1-2 minutes on each 
          side, or until pink. If using chicken, cook until just cooked through, about 3-4 minutes, flipping only 
          once.</li>
        <li>Push everything to the side of the pan. Add a little more oil and add the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs,
           breaking them into small pieces with a spatula as they cook.</li>
        <li>Add noodles, sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts to the pan (reserving some peanuts for topping at the end). 
          Toss everything to combine.</li>
        <li>Garnish the top with green onions, extra peanuts, cilantro and lime wedges. Serve immediately!</li>
        <li>Store leftovers in the fridge and enjoy within 2-3 days.</li>
      </ol>
