    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
        <li>⅓ cup butter, softened and cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley (Optional)</li>

      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Stir flour, Cheddar cheese, baking powder, salt, and garlic powder together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir milk, softened butter pieces, and egg together in a separate bowl. Add to the flour 
          mixture and stir until just combined and chunky, being very careful not to overmix.</li>
        <li>Drop batter by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir melted butter, parsley, and garlic powder together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Remove biscuits from the oven and brush melted butter mixture over top. Return to the oven and bake 
          until golden brown, about 5 more minutes. Serve warm.</li>
